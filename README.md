# Proposal Website 💌

A fun and interactive proposal website that walks visitors through a series of playful questions. Depending on their answers, the experience changes with humor, GIFs, and even a moving button to avoid rejection! 😂

## Demo 🎉
You can check out the live version of this project here:  
[**Proposal Website on GitHub Pages**](https://kycilius.github.io/proposal-site/)

## Features ✨
- **Interactive Questions:** 
  - "Are you alive?"  
  - "Are you a girl?"  
  - "Would you like to be my girlfriend?"  
- **Moving Button:** If the user tries to reject the proposal, the button moves around the screen.
- **GIF Responses:** Each answer triggers funny GIFs.
- **Meme Redirection:** If the user says they're not a girl, they’re redirected to a meme.

## How It Works 🛠️
1. **Question 1:**  
   If the answer is "No", a message shows that you only interact with the living.

2. **Question 2:**  
   If the answer is "No", the user is redirected to a meme. If "Yes", the next question is shown.

3. **Question 3:**  
   If the user tries to click "No", the button moves to avoid rejection! 😂

4. **Final Step:**  
   If the user agrees, a message thanks them for being your girlfriend.
